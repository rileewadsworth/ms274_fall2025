For my model experiment, I am focusing on the Elkhorn Slough in Elkhorn, California, a coastal estuary. 
My experiment is designed to simulate the effects of reduced wind speeds on water temperature and dissolved oxygen levels over the next decade. 
Using historical meteorological and hydrological data, I will create a computational model that links wind-driven mixing to changes in surface water temperature and oxygen solubility. 
I aim for the model to include seasonal variations and tidal influences to accurately capture natural fluctuations in the estuary.
I anticipate that reduced wind speeds will lead to decreased surface mixing, resulting in higher water temperatures during warm months. Consequently, I expect dissolved oxygen levels to decline due to the combined effects of warmer water and reduced aeration. 
By projecting these trends over ten years, the model will help assess potential stressors on aquatic life and inform local conservation strategies. 
Ultimately, this experiment aims to clarify the relationship between wind patterns and estuarine health in the face of climate variability.
